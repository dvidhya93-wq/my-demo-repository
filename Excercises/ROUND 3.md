API to pause scan POST /scan/{id}/pause 
returns scan status paused 
user can resume later 
if already paused return error 
api key required 
maybe timeout error also

CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS:

- What is the exact response structure for a successful pause request (fields such as scan_id, status)?

- What error code and message should be returned if the scan is already paused?

- What does "timeout error" refer to? Is there a specific status code (e.g., 408 or 500)?

- Does this API require any request body, or is the scan ID sufficient?

- Should the response include only the status, or additional details?

- What is the expected success status value (e.g., "paused")?

- Is there a standard error response format to follow across APIs?

No response to the questions.

## 🧠 ASSUMPTIONS (CRUCIAL)

```text
ASSUMPTIONS:
- Response includes only the scan status as "paused"
- Error codes and exact error structure are not defined, so only conditions are documented
- No request body is required as it is not specified in the input
```
